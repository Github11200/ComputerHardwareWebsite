## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Prequesites for running the program:
  - NPM
  - Node JS
  - Text editor (I will be using VS Code)

1) Download or clone the source code
2) Open it in a text editor such as VS Code
3) From the built in terminal in VS Code use the `cd` command and go to the Simulator folder.
4) Now run the command, `npm run dev`.
5) This should give you a localhost link from which you can view the project.

## üìù Usage
In order to use the application you can place points on the image of the vex Over Under field, and when you add 2 more more you will see a path is created. If you click run simulation the robot will follow this path and that will give you can approximation of what the robot will do. You will also see boxes with each point and that can let you adjust the properties of each point, and at the very bottom you will see the output for the C++ code as a object.
